# Phase 5: Trading Execution & Risk Management (Weeks 9-10)

## PRD Reference

**Source:** `/PRD.md`
**Key Requirements:**
- Integrate with IBKR paper trading account via ib_insync library
- Implement order submission (market orders) and tracking
- Build position reconciliation system (database vs broker reality)
- Implement position sizing calculator using 2% risk rule
- Enforce risk management rules: max 20% position size, max 50% portfolio allocation
- Implement stop-loss order placement at broker level (survives app crashes)
- Build daily loss limit detector (pause after 3 consecutive losses)
- **CRITICAL**: All stop-loss orders MUST be placed at broker level for safety

**Development Approach:** Implementation-first with manual testing, automated tests and documentation at end of cycle

## Relevant Files

- `backend/app/services/trading/` - Trading services directory
- `backend/app/services/trading/ibkr_client.py` - IBKR API wrapper using ib_insync
- `backend/app/services/trading/order_service.py` - Order submission and tracking
- `backend/app/services/trading/position_service.py` - Position management and reconciliation
- `backend/app/services/trading/execution_engine.py` - Main trade execution coordinator

- `backend/app/services/risk/risk_manager.py` - Risk rule enforcement engine
- `backend/app/services/risk/loss_limit_detector.py` - Daily loss limit tracker
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/trading.py` - Trading API endpoints
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/orders.py` - Order management API
- `backend/app/schemas/order.py` - Order schemas
- `backend/app/schemas/position.py` - Position schemas

### Files to Modify:
- `backend/app/main.py` - Add trading routes
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add IBKR credentials
- `backend/app/models/order.py` - May need additional fields
- `backend/app/models/trade.py` - Add risk management fields
- `backend/app/services/strategies/signal_generator.py` - Connect to execution engine
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Add ib_insync

### Notes

- Focus on safe, tested order execution that can be verified in IBKR paper account
- Test all scenarios: successful orders, rejections, insufficient funds, market closed
- Verify stop-loss orders are placed at broker level (visible in IBKR TWS/Gateway)
- Test crash recovery by stopping app and verifying positions reconcile
- Automated tests will be created at end of Phase 5
