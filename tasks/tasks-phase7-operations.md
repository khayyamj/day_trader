# Phase 7: System Operations & Monitoring (Weeks 13-14)

## PRD Reference

**Source:** `/PRD.md`
**Key Requirements:**
- Implement email notification service for trade execution, alerts, daily summaries
- Build comprehensive event logging system for audit trail
- Create crash recovery procedure with position reconciliation
- Set up systemd service for automatic restart (max 5 restarts in 10 minutes)
- Implement daily summary email at market close (4:30 PM ET)
- Create system health monitoring endpoints
- Run comprehensive integration tests across all components
- Perform load and stress testing
- Fix critical bugs identified during testing
- Complete deployment documentation and user manual

**Development Approach:** Implementation-first with manual testing, automated tests and documentation at end of cycle

### Notes

- Focus on implementing reliable operations that can be monitored
- Test all failure scenarios: email failures, crashes, API outages
- Verify systemd service restarts app correctly after crashes
- Test daily summary email by manually triggering
- Comprehensive integration tests are critical for Phase 7
- Bug fixing and polishing takes priority in Week 14
