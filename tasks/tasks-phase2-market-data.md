# Phase 2: Market Data Integration (Weeks 3-4)

## PRD Reference

**Source:** `/PRD.md`
**Key Requirements:**
- Integrate Twelve Data API for historical OHLCV data (1 year per stock)
- Implement real-time price streaming during market hours
- Build stock watchlist management (5-10 stocks max)
- Create data update scheduler for daily bar completion (4:05 PM ET)
- Implement rate limiting for API calls (8/minute, 800/day free tier)
- Add market hours detection logic

**Development Approach:** Implementation-first with manual testing, automated tests and documentation at end of cycle

## Relevant Files

### To Be Created:
- `backend/app/services/` - Services directory
- `backend/app/services/data/` - Market data services
- `backend/app/services/data/twelve_data_client.py` - Twelve Data API wrapper
- `backend/app/services/data/data_service.py` - Historical data fetching service
- `backend/app/services/data/realtime_service.py` - Real-time price streaming
- `backend/app/services/data/scheduler.py` - Data update scheduler
- `backend/app/services/data/market_hours.py` - Market hours utility
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/stocks.py` - Stock watchlist API
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/market_data.py` - Market data API
- `backend/app/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas directory
- `backend/app/schemas/stock.py` - Stock request/response schemas
- `backend/app/schemas/market_data.py` - Market data schemas
- `backend/app/core/rate_limiter.py` - API rate limiting utility

### Files to Modify:
- `backend/app/main.py` - Add new API routes
- `backend/app/models/stock.py` - May need relationship updates
- `backend/app/models/stock_data.py` - May need indexes

### Notes

- Focus on implementing data fetching that can be manually tested via API endpoints
- Use Postman or curl to verify data is stored correctly in database
- Test rate limiting by making rapid API calls
- Automated tests will be created at end of Phase 2
